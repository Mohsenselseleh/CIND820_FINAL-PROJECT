This research tries to compare different supervised classification models to predict customer credit for a german bank.
I have used ensemble models(decision trees,random forest and xgboosting) and traditional models(naive bayes,neural networks,svm,logistic regression , knn).
Results show that all the models were good at performance but random forest and neural networks were better than others.
