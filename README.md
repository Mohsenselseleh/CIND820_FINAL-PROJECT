This research tries to compare different supervised classification models to predict customer credit for a german bank.
I have used ensemble models(decision trees,random forest and xgboosting) and traditional models(naive bayes,neural networks,svm,logistic regression , knn).
Results show that all the models were good at performance but random forest and neural networks were better than others.
dataset sourced from: Statlog (German Credit Data) Data Set
Dataset has 21 features for one thousand instances. seven variables are quantitative
and thirteen are nominal. The dependent variable is Cost Matrix that show customer was good (1) or bad (0) in regard with repay their loan.

Result: I could see that there is not significant difference between ensemble methods and traditional methods for prediction customer credit at my data set. All the methods had good metrics for classification and prediction. Although, random forest and neural network had the highest accuracy.
